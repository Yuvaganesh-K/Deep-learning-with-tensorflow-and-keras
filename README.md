# Deep-learning-with-tensorflow-and-keras
The aim of this project is to demonstrate the use of tensorflow library for deep learning, and to give an idea on convolutional neural networks. 
The CIFAR10 dataset is used for the demonstration, which contains 60,000 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images in each class. 
The neural network takes tensors of 2-dimensional shape. Multiple epochs are used to reduce the loss function and to improve the accuracy of the deep learning model.
